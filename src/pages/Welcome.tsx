          Since then itâ€™s still not yet added to the Hub but thanks to CosmWasm
          and the ability to write smart contracts on Cosmos blockchains, this
          feature is here now.

          How it works? <br />
        </div>
        <div className="text-lg">
          <div>
            - Contract is instantiated with a given list of admins and a
            variable for making the list mutable/immutable. <br />
          </div>
          <div>
            - Admins can update the admin list if needed.
            <br />
          </div>
          <div>
            - Admins can freeze the admin list, making it immutable forever.
            <br />
          </div>
          <div>
            - Admins increase/decrease allowance for any wallet they add.
            <br />
          </div>
          <div>
            - Admins can set permissions to wallets for relaying different
            messages. This is limited to 4 for now. (delegate, undelegate,
            redelegate, withdraw)
            <br />
          </div>
          <div>
            - Wallet owners can relay send messages to get tokens that are
            allocated to them with allowance feature.
            <br />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-3xl font-bold my-3">
          Use cases <br />
        </div>
        <div className="text-lg">
          <div>
            - People can use this contract to utilize as a single shared account
            between themselves. They can lock up tokens and get them based on
            their allowance. <br />
          </div>
          <div>
            - This example can also be implemented in a bigger environment such
            as a company. Different accounts and subkeys can be made to do
            internal allocations. <br />
          </div>
          <div>
            - In our use case we have a validator that is running and in order
            to fairly distribute the rewards among the team, we setup a single
            account that gets all the rewards and give allowance to the people
            who'll get those. <br />
          </div>

            Connecting the wallet is only supported through the Keplr extension.{" "}

            You might not be able to use your Ledger to sign transactions for
            now. <br />
            We are working on it!
